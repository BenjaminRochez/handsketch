        ChoirMob is an interactive installation, musical and participative that comes as a choir of voices coming from mobile phones. In this project we have met a very particular challenge: to communicate to the visitor the feeling of really playing and sharing the music. The installation consists in a set of smartphones scattered in the room, either suspended from the ceiling, either on pedestals. Every smartphone is an instrument of music in itself, result of a long process of research and development in digital new instruments. Each smartphone, when touched, generates a singing voice, albeit artificial, but very realistic and expressive. These lyrical and ethereal voice, outputs of a technology object, are disturbing and confounding by their humanity. The visitor, through his fingertips, brings to life this avatar.
